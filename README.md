Computational Intelligence Project
Overview
This project is part of CSE473: Computational Intelligence and consists of two milestones:

Milestone 1: Comparison of optimization algorithms (SGDR, NAG, RMSProp, Nadam, and Learning Rate Schedulers) using CIFAR-10 with a shallow neural network. Training time, accuracy, and loss are recorded.

Milestone 2: Implementation of encoder-decoder networks (Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, Convolutional Autoencoder) for face recognition using CASIA-WebFace or FRGC datasets, with performance comparison and visualization.
